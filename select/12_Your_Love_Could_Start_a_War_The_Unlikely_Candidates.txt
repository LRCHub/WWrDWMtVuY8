The dawn will break before you
Under your thumb I'm on my knees

You're burning up the sky you're a constellation
Swear that I could die in this revelation
Oh, your love

Your love

You're riot dancing but I just want to fly

Oh, your love
Your love could start a war
Your love could start a war
It's what I'm fighting for
