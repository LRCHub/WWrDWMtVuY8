Lets start a war said maggie one day
With the unemployed masses we'll just do away
They won't mind, like sheep they'll go
They won't suss us, they'll never know
Lets start a war said maggie one day
Lets start a war said maggie one day
Lets start a war said maggie one day
You fight for your country
You die for their gain
Death and destruction all around
Shops and houses are razed to the ground
Burnt out houses empty shells
Here on earth it's just a mortal hell
Lets start a war said maggie one day
Lets start a war said maggie one day
Lets start a war said maggie one day
You fight for your country
You die for their gain
How they died no one will ever know
They said they would save us as deterrents they would be used
Except they brought destruction to an earth grows no food
No we are gone forever no tombs can hold your names
Lets start a war said maggie one day
Lets start a war said maggie one day
Lets start a war said maggie one day
You fight for your country
You die for their gain
