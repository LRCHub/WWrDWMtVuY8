I start to shiver when I'm not cold
Living in a world of winter
We all need someone to hold
Shine like gold everyday
It's all just torn away
I will stay
When I know what I need to say

I can't stop when I hear you calling
Don't let me go
I can't stop until I feel I'm falling
Higher and higher let's start a fire

You shake and shiver are you cold enough
Did you look into a mirror
Have you seen the poverty of love
Shadow of love everyday
It's all just torn away
I will stay
When I know what I need to say

I can't stop when I hear you calling
Don't let me go
I can't stop until I feel I'm falling
Higher and higher let's start a fire

I can't stop when I hear you calling
Don't let me go
I can't stop until I feel I'm falling
Higher and higher let's start a fire
