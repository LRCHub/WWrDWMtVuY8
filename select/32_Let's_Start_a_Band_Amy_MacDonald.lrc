[00:20.88] Put a ribbon round my neck and call me a libertine
[00:25.45] I will sing you songs of dreams I used to dream
[00:30.79] I will sail away on seas of silver and gold
[00:35.74] Until I reach my home
[00:41.19] Give me a guitar and I'll be your troubadour
[00:46.17] Your strolling minstrel 12th century door to door
[00:50.48] I don't know anymore, if that feeling is past will it last
[00:57.58] Oh, how can you be sure?
[01:09.58] 
[01:00.60] And how do I know if you're feeling the same as me?
[01:10.03] And how do I know if that's the only place you want to be?
[01:39.03] 
[01:21.58] Give me a stage and I'll be your rock and roll queen
[01:27.36] Your 20th century cover of a magazine
[01:31.16] Rolling Stone here I come, watch out everyone, I'm singing
[01:38.31] I'm singing my song
[01:42.14] Give me a festival and I'll be your Glastonbury star
[01:47.42] The lights are shining everyone knows who you are
[01:51.47] Singing songs about dreams about hopes about schemes
[01:57.51] Ooooh, they just came true
[02:10.51] 
[02:02.45] And how do I know if you're feeling the same as me?
[02:15.18] And how do I know if that's the only place you want to be?
[02:24.73] And how do I know if you're feeling the same as me?
[02:35.00] And how do I know if that's the only place you want to be?
[03:04.00] 
[03:16.05] And if you want it too, then there's nothing left to do:
[03:21.16] Let's start a band
[03:22.71] Let's start a band
[03:24.18] Let's start a band
[03:25.47] Let's start a band
[03:34.47] 
[03:26.89] And if you want it too, then there's nothing left to do:
[03:31.41] Let's start a band
[03:33.00] Let's start a band
[03:34.42] Let's start a band
[03:35.79] Let's start a band
[03:44.79] 
[03:37.06] And if you want it too, then there's nothing left to do:
[03:41.82] Let's start a band
[03:43.33] Let's start a band
[03:44.55] Let's start a band
[03:45.80] Let's start a band
[03:47.11] And if you want it too, then there's nothing left to do.
